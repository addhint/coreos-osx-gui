{"name":"CoreOS-OSX-GUI","tagline":"CoreOS-Vagrant GUI for OS X","body":"CoreOS-Vagrant GUI for Mac OS X\r\n============================\r\n\r\nCoreOS-Vagrant GUI for Mac OS X is a Mac Status bar App which works like a wrapper around the coreos-vagrant command line tool.\r\n[CoreOS](https://coreos.com) is a Linux distribution made specifically to run [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) containers.\r\n[CoreOS-Vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant) is made to run on VirtualBox and VMWare VMs.\r\n\r\n![CoreOS-Vagrant-GUI L](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui/blob/master/coreos-vagrant-gui.png \"CoreOS-Vagrant-GUI\")\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\nHead over to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui/releases) to grab the latest ZIP file with the ````App package````.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n----------\r\n\r\nRequired software\r\n* It needs ````VirtualBox for OS X```` to be present on the OS X.\r\nIf you do not have it, download [VirtualBox for Mac OS X hosts](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and install it.\r\n\r\n* It needs ````Vagrant for OS X```` to be present on the OS X too.\r\nIf you do not have it, download [Vagrant for Mac OS X](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and install it.\r\n\r\n* It needs ````iTerm 2```` to be present on the OS X too.\r\nIf you do not have it, download [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads) and install it.\r\n\r\n* Download the ````CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI latest.zip```` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/rimusz/coreos-osx-gui/releases) and unzip it.\r\n* Start the ````CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI```` and from menu ````Setup/Update```` choose ````Initial setup of CoreOS-Vagrant```` \r\n* and the install will do the following:\r\n````\r\n1) All dependent files/folders will be put under \"coreos-osx\" folder in the user's home folder e.g /Users/someuser/coreos-osx\r\n2) Will clone latest coreos-vagrant from git\r\n3) user-data file will have fleet, etcd, Docker Socket for the API and DockerUI enabled\r\n4) docker 4243 port will be set for docker OS X client to work properly\r\n5) Will set VM IP to 172.17.8.99 for DockerUI to properly open in a default web browser\r\n6) Will download and install fleet, etcd and docker OS X clients to ~/coreos-osx/bin/\r\n7) Will download latest vagrant VBox and run vagrant up to initialise VM\r\n8) Shared folder between host and VM will be created under ~/coreos-osx/share\r\n9) Will forward 80, 9000 and docker ports pool (49000..49900) including 4243 from host to vagrant VM.\r\n````\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n------------\r\n\r\nJust start ````CoreOS Vagrant OSX GUI```` application and you will find a small icon with the CoreOS logo in the Status Bar.\r\nFor now it only supports a standalone CoreOS VM, cluster support might come at same stage later one.\r\n\r\n* There you can ````Up````, ````Suspend````, ````Halt````, ````Reload```` CoreOS vagrant VM\r\n* Under ````Up & OS shell```` OS Shell will be opened when ````vagrant up```` finishes up and will have such environment set:\r\n````\r\nDOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:4243\r\nFLEETCTL_TUNNEL=127.0.0.1:2222\r\nPath to ~/coreos-osx/bin where docker, etcdclt and fleetctl binaries are stored\r\n```` \r\n* ````Setup/Update```` ````Check for updates```` will update to the latest docker, etcdclt and fleetctl OS X clients\r\n* ````SSH```` will open VM shell\r\n* [DockerUI](https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui) will show all running containers and etc (it might take a bit of a time after install for it to work as it needs to download it's image)\r\n\r\nTO-DOs\r\n------\r\n\r\n* Make sed to parse Vagrantfile with folder sharing, network IP and ports changes after git clone is done\r\n* Make it easier to add/delete docker ports.\r\n\r\nOther links\r\n-----------\r\nAlso you might like my other [boot2docker GUI for OS X](https://github.com/rimusz/boot2docker-gui-osx) project for [boot2docker](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker),\r\nas I use both projects depending on the work I need to do.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
